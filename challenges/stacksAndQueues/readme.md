## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
will i belive that all the methode added today were a big O of 1 becuse they were single action that resides in one single line of code with no itrations .
1. push big 0 OF 1 
2. pop big 0 OF 1
3. peel big 0 OF 1  
4. isEmpty big 0 OF 1 
5. enqueue  big 0 OF 1
6. dequeue  big 0 OF 1
